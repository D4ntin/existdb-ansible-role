# NOTE: when running multiple eXist-db instances on the same host, we
# distinguish between the "eXist-db system user" (var "exist_user") providing
# common filesystem resources to all instances, and the user actually
# running an eXist-db instance (var "exist_instuser"). This means in addition
# to the "existdb" system user, another user account gets created.
#
# This is not needed for single instance scenarios, as long as variable
# "exist_instuser" is left at its default value.
