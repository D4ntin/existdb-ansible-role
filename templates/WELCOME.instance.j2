# Welcome!

You are running eXist-db in a multi-instance setup on host
{{ network_hostname }}.  This setup was created by exist solutions
using the eXist-db Ansible role.

* instance name:    {{ exist_instname }}
* instance user:    {{ exist_instuser }}
* installation dir: {{ exist_path }}
* installed version:
{% if defined exist_http_host %}
* HTTP:             {{ exist_http_host }}:{{ exist_http_port }}
* HTTPS:            {{ exist_http_host }}:{{ exist_ssl_port }}
{% else %}
* HTTP port:        *:{{ exist_http_port }}
* HTTPS port:       *:{{ exist_http_port }}
{% endif %}

There is an nginx proxy in front of your eXist-db instance that listens on the
standard HTTP (80/tcp) and HTTPS (443/tcp) ports. It proxies requests to
{{ exist_instdns }} to the local ports of your instance.

A TLS certificate for {{ exist_instdns }} has been installed in nginx.

## Accessing the Instance

You should have received a password for your eXist-db instance. This is
* the admin password to access eXist-db
* the SSH user password for shell access

Access the instance with a Browser:
* `https://{{ exist_instdns }}/exist`

Access the instance with SSH:
* `ssh {{ exist_instuser }}@{{ network_hostname }}`

When logging in with SSH, you will be placed in `/home/{{ exist_instuser }}`.
There is a symbolic link `{{ exist_instname }}` that points to the installation
directory of your instance.

## Starting/Stopping the Instance

Use the commands below to manage your eXist-db instance from the shell.

```
{% if ansible_service_mgr == "systemd" %}
    systemctl start {{ exist_instname }}
    systemctl stop {{ exist_instname }}
    systemctl status {{ exist_instname }}
    systemctl restart {{ exist_instname }}
{% else %}
    service {{ exist_instname }} start
    service {{ exist_instname }} stop
    service {{ exist_instname }} status
    service {{ exist_instname }} restart
{% endif %}
```

## Miscellaneous

{% if exist_fdset_enable | boolean %}
The file descriptor limits for user "{{ exist_instuser }}" were raised to {{ exist_fdsoft_limit }}.
{% endif %}
